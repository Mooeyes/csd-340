             <p>
                 I have always enjoyed drawing and painting and in more recent years working digitally. I can't remember a time when 
                 wasn't doodling and I have always been fascinated with art/artists in general. I'm always looking to improve and experiment with
                 different media. I would often go to conventions and collect different prints and pieces in Artist Alley. Ultimately would love to
                 one day be more comfortable sharing my work and completing all the work I start.

             <p>
                 I love reading and books that span several genres and formats. I have always had a love for reading and at any given point am 
                 reading or rereading one or two books at a time. Reading provides a respite from the everyday life demands and makes me happy to 
                 have these relaxing escapist moments to myself. I have so many books in my possession that I have declared a halt on purchases. I can 
                 only buy digitally or borrow from the library. I will always accept any offers or opportunities to visit bookstores and or libraries!

                    I am fascinated by all the curious and exciting things the world has to offer. Travelling is my least developed
                    hobby as I really hate to fly but love hearing about and seeing things from all over the world. I have been making lists of foods, places,
                and experiences I want to try if I ever get the chance to visit any of my goal places. I love watching the Travel Channel and discovering new places both domestic and 
                international. I would love to one day experience all these wonders in person one day and have fun, interesting stories to tell about my travels.

                        I have been a Disney Cast Member for the past 14 years working in various roles throughout the different parks. I have spent 
                        most of my time working in the entertainment costuming department. I have learned quite a bit with this job, but feel like there's more
                        out there for me and hope to amp up my skill set and overall career longevity.

                        I had a brief stint selling some of paintings, buttons, and other crafts. It was a fun experience that I didn't take too seriously, and just
                        wanted to see if I could do it. I have always wanted to get back into it with a more serious intent and see what the end result could be. I like the 
                        idea of working for myself with something that I enjoy.

                        With everything happening recently I have been focused and taken a more intense look at what kind of future I want for myself.
                        I have always wanted to travel, have more versatility in my work, and to put more time into the things that
                        interest me. I am still trying to figure things out bit by bit and take things as they come. I'm pretty much a loner
                        with a lot of interests, very little time, and a job that I used to love but now semi-like. My ultimate dream would 
                        be to work remotely, possibly become an expat and move to New Zealand.
